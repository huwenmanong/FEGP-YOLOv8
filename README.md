# FEGP-YOLOv8
This project uses the self-developed lightweight model, FEGP-YOLOv8, to achieve real-time UAV target detection. Both the accuracy and real-time performance have been significantly improved.
The usage of this project is the same as that of the official YOLOv8, so no redundant description will be given here. To meet the editor's requirements, a dependency file has been created in the project. However, to avoid conflicts of interest, the project has not been open-sourced, and the dataset and other algorithm models involved are the achievements of other teams or individuals. This may cause inconvenience to readers, and we apologize for this. If readers need assistance, they can send us an email, and we will do our best to provide help within the scope of our responsibilities.
