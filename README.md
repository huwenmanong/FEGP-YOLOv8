# FEGP-YOLOv8
This project is directly related to the manuscript in The Visual Computer: "Enhanced Feature Learning and Model Lightweighting for Real-Time UAV Detection Using FEGP-YOLOv8". We kindly request that when using this project, you cite the aforementioned manuscript from the journal.This project uses the self-developed lightweight model, FEGP-YOLOv8, to achieve real-time UAV target detection. Both the accuracy and real-time performance have been significantly improved.The usage of this project is the same as that of the official YOLOv8, so no redundant description will be given here. The datasets and algorithms used in this project are all described in detail in the manuscript. However, to avoid conflicts of interest, We are unable to provide the datasets and models developed by other teams or individuals. Please contact the original authors for access to the original datasets and models. This may cause inconvenience to readers, and we apologize for this. If readers need assistance, they can send us an email, and we will do our best to provide help within the scope of our responsibilities.
